- Once the user clicks the Start button, the first question is set, a timer appears in the upper left-hand corner, and the countdown begins. When the user clicks on their selected response, they get a brief "Yay!" or "Oooops!" message and the next question appears on the screen.

- Each incorrect answer results in a 10-second deduction from the clock.

- The user's final score is the time remaining on the clock at the end of the quiz.

- The user can then add their initials to the High Score list and see how they have done against their prior times or against another user.

- From there, the user can choose to restart the quiz or to clear the high scores and then restart the quiz.
